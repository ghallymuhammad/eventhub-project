# React Marquee Implementation

## Overview
Successfully integrated `react-fast-marquee` into the EventHub homepage to display featured events and announcements in a dynamic, scrolling marquee format.

## Implementation Details

### Location
- **Component**: `/web/src/components/EventHomepage.tsx`
- **Position**: Between the hero section and events section

### Features
1. **Dynamic Content**: Displays featured events when available, falls back to announcements
2. **Interactive**: Clickable event cards that link to event detail pages
3. **Responsive**: Adapts to different screen sizes
4. **Smooth Animation**: Configurable scroll speed with pause on hover
5. **Visual Appeal**: Gradient background with glassmorphism effects

### Configuration
```tsx
<Marquee 
  gradient={true}
  gradientColor="rgb(147, 51, 234)" // purple-600
  gradientWidth={100}
  speed={50}
  pauseOnHover={true}
  className="py-2"
>
```

### Content Logic
- **Primary**: Shows up to 6 featured events with:
  - Event title, date, location, and price
  - Category icon
  - Hover effects and transitions
  - Direct links to event details
  
- **Fallback**: Generic announcements when no featured events available:
  - New events notifications
  - Registration reminders
  - Category-specific promotions

### Styling
- **Background**: Purple to pink gradient matching the site theme
- **Cards**: Glassmorphism design with backdrop blur
- **Typography**: Clear, readable text with hover states
- **Icons**: Category-specific emojis for visual appeal

### User Experience
- **Pause on Hover**: Users can pause scrolling to read content
- **Smooth Transitions**: Hover effects provide visual feedback
- **Accessible**: Keyboard navigation supported through Link components
- **Mobile Friendly**: Responsive design works on all devices

## Dependencies

## Benefits

2. **Discovery**: Helps users find popular events
3. **Visual Appeal**: Adds dynamic movement to the homepage
4. **Conversion**: Direct links encourage event exploration
5. **Flexibility**: Easy to update content and styling
