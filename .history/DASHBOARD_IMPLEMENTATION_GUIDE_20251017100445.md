Smart routing component that redirects users to the appropriate dashboard based on their role:
- **ADMIN** ‚Üí `/admin`

### Protected Routes
All dashboards use the `ProtectedRoute` component with role-based access control:
```tsx
<ProtectedRoute requireAuth={true} requireRole="ADMIN">
  {/* Dashboard content */}
</ProtectedRoute>
```

### API Integration
Enhanced API library with dedicated endpoints:
- `api.admin.*` - Admin management functions
- `api.organizer.*` - Organizer tools and analytics
- `api.dashboard.*` - User dashboard data

### Navigation Integration
