# Login Flow Debug Summary

## Issues Found and Fixed:

1. **Token Storage Mismatch** ✅ FIXED
   - Frontend was storing: `localStorage.setItem('auth_token', token)`
   - useAuth hook was looking for: `localStorage.getItem('token')`
   - **Fix**: Changed frontend to store as 'token'

2. **Auth Verification Endpoint** ✅ FIXED
   - useAuth hook was calling: `/api/auth/verify` (doesn't exist)
   - Backend has: `/api/auth/profile` (requires Bearer token)
   - **Fix**: Updated useAuth hook to use correct endpoint

3. **CORS Configuration** ✅ FIXED
   - Frontend running on port 3009 but CORS only allowed up to 3008
   - **Fix**: Added port 3009 to CORS origins

4. **Login Redirect Path** ✅ FIXED
   - useAuth hook redirectTo was: `/auth/login`
   - Actual login page is: `/login`
   - **Fix**: Updated redirectTo path

5. **Post-Login Redirect** ✅ FIXED
   - Was redirecting to: `/dashboard`
   - Changed to: `/` (homepage with EventHomepage component)

## Current Status:
- ✅ API server running on http://localhost:8000
- ✅ Frontend running on http://localhost:3009  
- ✅ Login API endpoint working (tested with curl)
- ✅ Auth profile endpoint working (tested with curl)
- ✅ CORS properly configured
- ✅ Debugging console logs added to frontend

## Test Credentials:
- Email: login.test@example.com
- Password: password123

## Next Steps:
1. Test login through frontend UI
2. Verify token storage and retrieval
3. Verify post-login redirect works
4. Verify EventHomepage shows authenticated state
