# ðŸŽ« EventHub - Mock Data Guide

## ðŸ“‹ Overview

EventHub now includes a comprehensive mock data system that allows you to test the complete ticket purchase flow without needing a backend API. This is perfect for development, testing, and demonstration purposes.

## ðŸš€ Quick Start with Mock Data

### 1. Enable Mock Data Mode

The mock data system is controlled by an environment variable. To enable it:

```bash
# In your .env.local file
NEXT_PUBLIC_USE_MOCK_DATA=true
```

### 2. Access the Demo Page

Visit `/mock-demo` to see all mock data in action:
```
http://localhost:3002/mock-demo
```

### 3. Test the Complete Flow

1. **Event Selection**: Browse 4 sample events with different categories
2. **Checkout**: `/checkout/[eventId]` - Select tickets and enter user info
3. **Payment**: `/payment/[transactionId]` - View payment instructions with countdown
4. **Upload**: `/payment/[transactionId]/upload` - Upload payment proof
5. **Success**: `/payment/[transactionId]/success` - View confirmation page
6. **Dashboard**: `/dashboard` - See transaction history and stats

## ðŸ“Š Available Mock Data

### Events (4 sample events)
- **Tech Conference 2025**: Technology event with multiple ticket tiers
- **Jakarta Music Festival**: 3-day music festival with VIP options  
- **Startup Pitch Competition**: Business event with student discounts
- **Community Art Workshop**: Free arts & crafts event

### Tickets (8 different ticket types)

## ðŸ›  How Mock Data Works

### API Integration
The mock system seamlessly integrates with your existing API calls:

```typescript
// When USE_MOCK_DATA=true, this returns mock data
const events = await api.events.getAll();

// When USE_MOCK_DATA=false, this calls real API
const events = await api.events.getAll(); // â†’ HTTP request
```

### Simulated Features
- **API Delays**: Realistic loading times (200ms - 2s)
- **Error Handling**: Proper error states and messages  
- **File Uploads**: Simulated image upload with progress
- **Real-time Updates**: Countdown timers and status changes
- **Form Validation**: Complete form validation with error states

### Data Persistence
Mock data persists during your session but resets on page refresh. Perfect for testing different scenarios.

## ðŸŽ¯ Testing Scenarios

### 1. Complete Purchase Flow
```bash
# Start at homepage
http://localhost:3002/

# Select an event â†’ Checkout â†’ Payment â†’ Upload â†’ Success
```

### 2. Different Event Types
- **Free Events**: Test free registration flow
- **Paid Events**: Test multiple ticket types and pricing
- **Sold Out**: Test unavailable tickets (modify mock data)

### 3. User Dashboard
```bash
# View transaction history and user stats
http://localhost:3002/dashboard
```

### 4. Error States
- Invalid transaction IDs
- Expired payment sessions  
- File upload errors
- Form validation errors

## ðŸ”§ Customizing Mock Data

### Adding New Events
Edit `/src/data/mockData.ts`:

```typescript
const newEvent: MockEvent = {
  id: 5,
  name: "Your Event Name",
  description: "Event description...",
  category: "MUSIC", // MUSIC, TECHNOLOGY, BUSINESS, etc.
  location: "Jakarta",
  address: "Full address...",
  startDate: "2025-12-01T19:00:00Z",
  endDate: "2025-12-01T23:00:00Z",
  price: 0,
  availableSeats: 100,
  totalSeats: 100,
  isFree: false,
  imageUrl: "https://example.com/image.jpg",
  organizer: mockUser,
  createdAt: new Date().toISOString(),
  updatedAt: new Date().toISOString()
};

mockEvents.push(newEvent);
```

### Adding New Tickets
```typescript
const newTicket: MockTicket = {
  id: 9,
  eventId: 5, // Match your event ID
  type: "VIP",
  name: "VIP Experience",
  description: "Premium access with perks",
  price: 150000000, // Price in cents (IDR 1,500,000)
  availableSeats: 50,
  totalSeats: 50,
  createdAt: new Date().toISOString(),
  updatedAt: new Date().toISOString()
};

mockTickets.push(newTicket);
```

### Modifying Bank Accounts
```typescript
mockBankAccounts.push({
  bankName: "Your Bank Name",
  accountNumber: "1234567890",
  accountName: "EventHub Indonesia",
  bankCode: "BANK_CODE"
});
```
